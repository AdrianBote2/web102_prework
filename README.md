## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Challenges that were encountered while coding the project were grabbing each objects value correctly with the for loop because it required more steps compared to a simple array. Another challenge I encountered was correctly applying the spread and destructuring methods to work together and grab the two front items of the sorted list, this challenge was most challenging for me because I had to dive deeper into this section of javascript to fully understand it compared to the other syntaxes.
